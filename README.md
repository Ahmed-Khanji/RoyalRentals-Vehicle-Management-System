# RoyalRentals Vehicle Management System

**RoyalRentals Vehicle Management System** is a Java console-based application. It allows users to manage a rental service for a diverse vehicle fleet, including electric/diesel trucks and electric/gasoline cars. The system supports adding, updating, deleting, and listing vehicles, along with leasing and returning operations for registered clients.

The project demonstrates strong use of **object-oriented programming** principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and copy constructors, organized across multiple packages (`vehicles`, `clients`, `driver`). It leverages **generics** to create reusable methods for adding, deleting, and updating arrays dynamically, and uses **array resizing and manipulation** to manage vehicle and lease records without built-in collections.

It also features **menu-driven input handling**, **custom `equals` and `toString` methods**, and interactive **predefined testing scenarios**. This project highlights practical Java skills in structuring scalable programs, managing class relationships, and simulating real-world operations through modular design.
